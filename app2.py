# While loop

# Guessing Game

# secret_number = 8
# Guess_Count =0
# Guess_Limit = 3
# while Guess_Count<Guess_Limit:
#     guess = int(input("Guess: "))
#     Guess_Count+=1
#     if guess == secret_number:
#         print("You Won")
#         break
# else:
#     print("You Failed")

# Basic while loop

# i = 1
# while i<6:
#     print(i * '*')
#     i+=1
# print('Completed')

# For loop

# prices = [20, 30, 45, 32]
#
# sum = 0
#
# for price in prices:
#     sum = sum+price
#
# print(f'Total: {sum}')


# Nested loop

# numbers = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,5]
#
# for x in numbers:
#     output = ''
#     for y in range(x):
#         output+='*'
#     print(output)

# List are mutable

# names = ['john', 'mary', 'joe', 'peter']
#
# print(names[:])

# program to find max number from list

# numbers = [2,3,4,5,3,44,34,65,77,99,2,3,4]
# max = numbers[0]
#
# for number in numbers:
#     if number > max:
#         max = number
# print(max)


# 2d list - two dimensional

# matrix = [
#     [1,2,4],
#     [4,5,6],
#     [4,6,7]
# ]
#
# for col in matrix:
#     for item in col:
#         print(item*2)


# List Methods

# 1. append- which adds numbers to the list to the last
# 2. insert- which adds number to the front of list
# 3. remove- which removes a number from list
# 4. clear- which clears a total list

# it removes duplicates from the list

# numbers = [3,3,4,3,5,6,1,2,7,7,6,5,8,9]
#
# final = list(set(numbers))
# print(final)

# tuples- this is immutable
